findyouranimal
==============

A simple Akinator-like game which main objective is to adapt it to the knowledge of the user. It is done by providing an initial quantity of animals preconfigured and it grows everytime the program doesn't find the animal the user was thinking and the user inserts it (if you search again, the animal you configured will be there)

It helped me understanding and applying data structure knowledges to problem solutions, in this case mainly the ["Doubly linked list" data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list "Wikipedia: Doubly linked list")
